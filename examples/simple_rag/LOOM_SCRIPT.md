## 0:00 - The Problem (Face)

"We all know ChatGPT is great, but you can't trust it with your company's private data. It hallucinates and doesn't know your internal policies."

## 0:15 - The Solution (Screen: Chat UI)

"This is 'CSBrain', a secure RAG chatbot I built. It's connected to a private database of PDF documents—in this case, a mock 'Project Phoenix' strategy memo."

## 0:30 - The Demo (Screen: Chat UI)

"Watch what happens when I ask: 'What is the goal of Project Phoenix?'"

_(Action: Type query)_

"It answers instantly: 'Reduce server costs by 40%'. But look at this..."

## 0:45 - The Citation (Screen: Zoom in on Citation)

"It provides a direct citation: 'Source: strategy_memo.pdf, Page 2'. This builds trust. You can verify every single claim."

## 0:55 - Guardrails (Screen: Chat UI)

"And if I ask something irrelevant like 'Who won the Super Bowl?', it politely refuses. It stays strictly within your business context."

## 1:05 - Outro (Face)

"If you need a secure AI assistant that actually knows your business, let's build this for you."
